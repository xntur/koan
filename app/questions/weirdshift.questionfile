Weird Shift
A "weird shift" is when you take all the characters in a string, remove all 'a's, 'e', and 'o's, then shift the remaining letters 1 digit to the right. For instance, "ebzos" -> "bzs" -> "cat". What do you get after "weird shifting" "atelnmyvtokdckw" 5 times? Note: 'z' shifts to 'a'. Note: you should remove the vowels as part of every shift, not just the first time.
