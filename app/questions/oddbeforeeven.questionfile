Odd Before Even
There are 4 ways to order the numbers 1-4 where the odd numbers come before the even ones [(1, 3, 2, 4), (3,1,2,4),(1,3,4,2),(3,1,4,2)]. How many ways are there to do the same for numbers 1-100? Only submit the first 10 digits of the answer, because it is very long and ends with a bunch of 0s.
