<h3>Welcome to Koan!</h3>
Koan was a coding competition app made for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Tech-Interviews">Chicago Tech Interviews</a> meetup, but we've left it up for anyone to play with :) 
<br><br>
To start, we'll need a name for you or the team you're playing with. Use the same team name on multiple devices to share work!
    <form action="" method="post" novalidate>
      <p>Team Name <input type = "text" name = "team" /></p>
      <p><input type = "submit" value = "submit" /></p>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
