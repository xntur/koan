# koan

Koan was a project for the [Chicago Tech Interviews](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Tech-Interviews/) meetup in 2019. It was a simple flask wrapper around a handful of coding questions for a 2 hour friendly competition. I used it as an opportunity to make my first website since college (work has me editing lots of code but not doing anything from scratch); it is written in python/flask with a very simple UI.
